# Budgetr backend

## TODO List:

- [ ] Filter user routes to not return password hash
- [ ] Fix .env variables in modules
- [ ] For GET moneypocket add a param option of withTransactions so we only fetch transactions when needed
- [ ] Protect endpoints with authentication after all are done
- [ ] Update transaction endpoint created with attention to currency (should be the same with the money pocket) 
- [ ] Migrate class-validator to zod 
- [ ] Finish pocket type validation
- [ ] Fix .env variables in auth strategies
- [ ] Validate ids given as params to requests
- [ ] Update Auth service tests
